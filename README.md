Restaurant Billing System
Introduction
The Restaurant Billing System is a basic application designed to simplify customer billing in restaurants, caf√©s, department stores, and shops. This system allows restaurant owners to track frequent customers and manage bill calculations efficiently, eliminating the complexities of manual billing. The application helps store customer details such as name, address, phone number, payment amounts, due amounts, payment dates, and more.

With this system, restaurant owners can easily generate bills, manage customer transactions, and maintain a permanent record of all transactions. The system also helps to reduce the maintenance costs compared to manual systems and allows flexibility in adapting to user needs.
